### Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to create a web-based chat platform that allows users to connect with random strangers in real-time. The platform should be easy to use, intuitive, and reliable. The project must be completed within a limited time frame and budget.

### UI Guidelines:

1. The user interface should be simple, clean, and easy to navigate.

2. The platform should have a minimalist design with a white background to ensure that the focus is on the chat window.

3. The chat window should be the primary focus of the UI, with minimal distractions such as ads or pop-ups.

4. The chat window should display the user's messages on one side and the stranger's messages on the other side to make it clear who is saying what.

5. The platform should include a chat log that allows users to view previous conversations.

### Functionality Guidelines:

1. The platform should allow users to connect with a random stranger with a single click of a button.

2. The platform should include a feature that allows users to disconnect and reconnect with a new stranger.

3. The platform should have a message filter to prevent inappropriate content from being sent.

4. The platform should support real-time audio and video chat, as well as text chat.

5. The platform should include a reporting system that allows users to report inappropriate behavior.

### Testing Guidelines:

1. Conduct functional testing to ensure that all features are working as expected.

2. Conduct performance testing to ensure that the platform can handle multiple users simultaneously.

3. Conduct security testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

4. Conduct usability testing to ensure that the platform is easy to use and navigate.
